### Data Loading: 
Ensure the job data CSV file is correctly placed and accessible. Load the data and preprocess it by combining job descriptions and requirements.
### Embedding Creation: 
Initialize the Sentence Transformer model and create embeddings for the combined job details in manageable chunks.
### FAISS Indexing: 
Initialize a FAISS index with the appropriate dimensions and add job embeddings to the FAISS index for efficient similarity search.
### Model Initialization: 
Load the tokenizer and generative model (e.g., LlamaForCausalLM). Move the model to GPU if available for faster processing.
### Query Processing: 
Use the retrieval function to get relevant job postings based on user queries. Generate a personalized response using the generative model.

### Requirements
Install Sentence Transformer and Faiss libraries through below commands
!pip install sentence-transformers beautifulsoup4
!pip install faiss-cpu
