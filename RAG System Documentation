1. Introduction
The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system is designed to provide personalized skill recommendations and career advice to users based on their queries about specific job roles. The system leverages both retrieval-based techniques and generative models to craft tailored responses.

2. System Architecture
The RAG system comprises three main components:

Data Preparation: Process job data to create document embeddings.
Retrieval Component: Retrieve relevant job postings using vector similarity search.
Generation Component: Generate personalized responses using a generative model.

3. Data Preparation
Objective: Utilize the provided jobs data to create document embeddings using Sentence Transformers.

Steps:
Load Job Data: Read the jobs data which includes fields like job title, job description, job requirements, and career level.
Create Document Embeddings: Use Sentence Transformers to encode job details into dense vectors.

4. Retrieval Component
Objective: Retrieve relevant job postings based on user queries using a vector database like Elasticsearch with ElastiKNN, Faiss, or Pinecone.

Steps:
Initialize Vector Database: Weâ€™ll use Pinecone for this example.
Store Embeddings: Upsert job embeddings into the Pinecone index.
Search Mechanism: Embed user query and perform vector similarity search.
